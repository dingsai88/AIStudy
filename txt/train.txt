The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Pineapples are juicy and delicious.
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.
A rolling stone gathers no moss.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
Honesty is the best policy.
Time and tide wait for no man.
A stitch in time saves nine.
The early bird catches the worm.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
